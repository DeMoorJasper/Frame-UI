# TODO
## Add support for more properties
Support more properties of an html object like href, src,...
## update construct function to check if id and classes is empty
Add new if statements or something to check if array classes and id is empty so we don't end up having a lot of empty id and class properties
## Remove repetition
Cleanup code and create "constructors"
